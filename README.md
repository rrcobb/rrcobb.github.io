Hi! I'm Rob. 

This is my website code. It's run through Jekyll, but the index page is its own static page monstrosity. 


TODO:
update links in home nav

Landing should be dedicated, resume should be a clean link
Resume page might need to not look the way it does.
Thumbnail images/ header images for posts/ default if the posts don't have them
