[2015 note: I never finished this post, but I figure you deserve to see it, if you're here]

Hi friends,<br /><br />So it turns out that I am not the kind of person who frequently updates blogs. I'm sorry about that, since I promised on several previous posts that I was going to try to be better. This whole study abroad trip experience is about learning new things about myself and the world - now I know more about my own blogging habits.<br /><br />A lot has gone on since the last time I wrote a blog entry - friends made, places visited, lessons learned. Lots of books and food and sleep, lots of adventures. Like most folks my age, I am a poor chronicler of my life - never writing down the important things immediately, as I should. I'll try to tell you some fun stories now, but they're all from a lens of weeks and months, so I don't know how clear it will all be. I'm trying, anyway.<br /><br />I'll try to put pictures in line in this post, since I haven't done that before and trying new things is good for me, I hear.<br /><br />So, the last post I made was pictures from skiing, and the last one with words talked about classes and skiing and gangs, which is exciting, but not really that exciting anymore, since it was a long time ago now. Since then, there has been: Easter Trip to the<b> Lofoten Islands, </b>a several day getaway to <b>Berlin, </b>lots more work and fun with <b>Diverse Gjengen </b>(perennial crowd favorite, the gang).<b>&nbsp;</b>I'll also try to talk about the differences I've noticed between Norwegian and American culture, and some of the lessons I have learned while being abroad. I'll try to make it as interesting and reader-friendly as possible, but you're already half a page in, I figure you'll stick around!<br /><br />In Norway, there is no spring break, because spring only comes about now (Late April) and the end of the semester is not time for a break. Instead, there is Easter break. Norway is culturally conservative in many ways; even though most of the population is&nbsp;atheist&nbsp;or agnostic, the easter holiday remains a time for families to get together and eat and celebrate.<br /><br />
