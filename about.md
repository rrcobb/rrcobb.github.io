I'm Rob.

I'm currently running the [Winter Term Workshop](http://makesomething.cool) at UMD's Startup Shell. 

I graduated in December 2014 from UMD with a major I made - Entrepreneurship and Innovation in STEM Education. I'm working on making education better - more affordable, higher quality, more relevant, more student-focused. 

The blog is maintained with Jekyll, and uses the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about Jekyll at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

The code for this site is open-source, and I'd be flattered if you [forked me](https://github.com/rrcobb/rrcobb.github.io).
