I'm Rob.

I'm currently running the [Winter Term Workshop](http://makesomething.cool) at UMD's Startup Shell. 

This blog has the posts and articles I've written in the past few years - some on an old blog, many from my time writing for the university's student newspaper. 

I graduated in December 2014 from UMD with a major I made - Entrepreneurship and Innovation in STEM Education. I'm working on making education better - more affordable, higher quality, more relevant, more student-focused. 



The blog is maintained with Jekyll, and uses the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about Jekyll at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
